# Forza-Horizon-Tuning-Calculator
Tuning calculator designed to help you set up a base tune on your car in Forza Horizon 4.

The formula used for this program is from a [YT video by HokiHoshi](https://youtu.be/WM7_3NGGUoQ).

To get started you can just run the .exe file, however I am having issues with pyinstaller as the .exe gets flagged as a virus, otherwise you can just run the .py script.

This is obviously not a complete solution to tuning your car in Forza Horizon 4, this is just designed to be a good starting point.

Feedback is welcome, enjoy :)
